# Fediverse Icons for Jetpack
Add Fediverse SVG icons to Jetpack's [Social Menu](https://jetpack.com/support/social-menu/) module.

Example output:

<img alt="'Social menu' displaying Fediverse icons" src="https://janboddez.tech/uploads/2019/01/fediverse_icons.png" width="263" />

## Instructions
When adding a [Custom Link](https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_Screen#Custom_Links) to your Social Menu, set its Navigation Label to the platform you're linking to, e.g., 'GNU Social', 'Peertube', or 'Mastodon'.
 
Jetpack itself, you see, uses domain names, e.g., `facebook.com`, to decide which icon to apply. Since federated platforms can be hosted on just about any domain, that approach obviously would't work here. What does work, though, is to name menu items after the applicable Fediverse platform.
