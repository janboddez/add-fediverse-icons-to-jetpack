# Add Fediverse Icons to Jetpack
Add Fediverse SVG icons to Jetpack's [Social Menu](https://jetpack.com/support/social-menu/) module.

## Instructions
When adding a [Custom Link](https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_Screen#Custom_Links) to your Social Menu, set its Navigation Label to the platform you're linking to, e.g., 'GNU Social', 'Peertube', or 'Mastodon'.
 
While Jetpack itself uses domain names, e.g., `facebook.com`, to decide which icon to apply, that approach obviously wouldn't work here: federated platforms are hosted on all sorts of domains. What does work, though, is to name menu items after the applicable Fediverse platform.

## Example Output
<img alt="'Social menu' displaying Fediverse icons" src="https://janboddez.tech/uploads/2019/01/fediverse_icons.png" width="263" />
